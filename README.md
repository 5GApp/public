# OpenConfig

[**OpenConfig**](http://www.openconfig.net) is a collaborative effort by network operators to develop programmatic interfaces and tools for managing networks in a dynamic, vendor-neutral way.  OpenConfigâ€™s initial focus is on compiling a consistent set of vendor-neutral data models (written in [YANG](http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6020/))  based on actual operational needs from use cases and requirements from multiple network operators.


This repository contains published OpenConfig models, documentation, and other material for the community.

## Models

Published data models are in the release/models directory.
